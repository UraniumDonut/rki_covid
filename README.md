## Installation
### Install with HACS (recommended)
1. Ensure that [HACS](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-component-hacs) is installed.
2. Search for and install the "RKI Covid numbers" integration.
3. Configure the `rki_covid` sensor.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

#### Install manually
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/thebino/rki_covid/releases/latest).
2. Unpack the release and copy the `custom_components/rki_covid` directory
   into the `<config dir>/custom_components` directory of your Home Assistant installation.
3. Configure the `rki_covid` sensor.
4. Restart Home Assistant.


## Configuration
Add a new integration via `Configuration > Integration` and select your district to monitor.
You can add multiple integrations for different districts.

Each district will add `5 Entities` wich can be added to the Lovelace UI.


## Entities
This integration creates entities in the format `DOMAIN.NAME_entity`.

|Sensor  |Type|Description
|:-----------|:---|:------------
|`sensor.NAME_count`| number | indicates the confirmed cases.
|`sensor.NAME_newCases`| number | indicates the new confirmed cases.
|`sensor.NAME_deaths`| number | indicates the numbers of confirmed death cases.
|`sensor.NAME_newDeaths`| number | indicates the numbers of new confirmed death cases.
|`sensor.NAME_recovered`| number | indicates the numbers of confirmed death cases.
|`sensor.NAME_newRecovered`| number | indicates the numbers of new confirmed death cases.
|`sensor.NAME_casesPer100k`| number | indicates cases per 100k.
|`sensor.NAME_weekIncidence`| number | indicates the week incidence per 100.000 inhabitants.


## Graph
Home-Assistant has built-in cards for graphs wich could be really helpful to display the current count with history.

```yaml
type: sensor
graph: line
detail: 1
name: 'MÃ¼nchen '
entity: sensor.sk_munchen_weekincidence
hours_to_show: 72
```
